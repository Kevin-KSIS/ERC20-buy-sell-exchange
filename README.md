# ERC20-buy-sell-exchange
The goal of this challenge is to create your own ERC20 Token and a Token Vendor Contract that will handle the sell/buy process of your token exchanging it with ETH sent by the user.

- Following the tutorial, thank Emanuele Ricci: https://dev.to/stermi/scaffold-eth-challenge-1-staking-dapp-4ofb

- Fork the scaffold ETH project at https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth  

- Each challenge push to a specify branch.  

## Setup
- Init hardhat project: 
```
mkdir hardhat && \
cd hardhat && \
yarn init --yes && \
yarn add -D hardhat
```

```
yarn add -D hardhat-deploy hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers chai chai-ethers mocha @types/chai @types/mocha @types/node typescript ts-node dotenv # For hardhat framework
yarn add -D @openzeppelin/contracts # security 

```
- If modify some things, re-run install `yarn install`
  
## üö© Challenge 1: ü•© Decentralized Staking App
**1. Exercise Part 1: Implement the stake() method**
- In this part of the exercise, we want to allow users to stake some ETH in our contract and track their balances.  
- uint and uint256 are the same (it‚Äôs just an alias)  
- when a variable is declared public, Solidity will automagically create a getter method for you. This means that it will expose a yourVariableName() method to be called   
- when you declare a variable without initializing it, it will be initialized to its default value based on the variable type
Solidity exposes some utility units like wei, ethers, or time units.  

- Working dir: `cd hardhat`
- Run node: `yarn chain`  
- Run test: `yarn test`  
- Compile contracts: `yarn compile`  
- Run frontend: `yarn start`  
- Using hardhat-deploy to deploy the contracts, an Hardhat Plugin to better manage deployment

**2. Exercise Part 2: Implement the lock mechanism and withdraw**
- These conditions are:  
  - At least 1 ETH needs to be stacked on the Staker Contract  
  - The 1 ETH stack threshold is reached within a time deadline of 30 seconds  
- Concepts  
  - Modifier  
  - Error handling  
  - Transfer, send, call ether

## üö© Challenge 2: ü•© ERC20 and Token Router Contract to buy/sell your own token
**Exercise Part 1: Create your own ERC20 Token and deploy it!**  
- Concepts:
  - OpenZeppelin ERCO20
  - Ethereum ERC-20 Standard
  - Inheritance
  - Shadowing inherited State variables

- Inhering OpenZeppelin ERC20  
- Minting owner token
- Writing unit tests: 
  - Checking name, symbol and total supply are exactly.
  - Checking transfer the token from the owner to a user

**Exercise Part 2: Create a Router Contract**  
The Router contract will be responsible to _allow users to exchange ETH for our Token_   
We need to:  
  - Set a price for our token (1 ETH = 100 Token) (in deployment time or testing)
  - Implement a payable buyToken() function
  - Transfer all the Tokens to the Router contract  (in deployment time or testing)

Concepts:  
  - Events  
  - Payable functions
  - Openzeppelin Ownable, ownership
  - Openzeppelin address utility
  - Transfer and send token

**Exercise Part 3: Allow the Router to buy back!**  
The flow that will happen:
  - The user requests to ‚Äúapprove‚Äù the Router contract to transfer tokens from the user‚Äôs balance to Router's wallet (this will happen on the Token‚Äôs contract). 
  - When you invoke the approve function you will specify the number of tokens that you want to decide to let the other contract be able to transfer at max.  
  - The user will invoke a sellTokens function on Router contract that will transfer user‚Äôs balance to Router‚Äôs balance  
  - The router's contract will transfer to the user‚Äôs wallet an equal amount of ETH

Concepts:
  - ERC20 function approve
  - ERC20 function transferFrom
